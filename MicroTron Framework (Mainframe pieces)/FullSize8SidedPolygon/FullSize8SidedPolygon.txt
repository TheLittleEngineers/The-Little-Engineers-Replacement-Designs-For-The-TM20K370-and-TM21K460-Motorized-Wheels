The following files are of a full-scale representation of the MicroTron Robot Eight-Sided Polygon (referred to by Tod Loofbourrow as a non-equilateral octagon). Tod designed the MicroTron ("Mike") Robot around the Herbach & Rademan TM20K370 Motorized Wheels. As such, Tod constructed the majority of the robot from 1"x1"x.125" (25.4mm x 25.4mm x 3.175mm) Aluminum Angle Stock. This Aluminum Angle was used, initially, to create an equilateral triangle 23" (584.2mm) on a side with the angle aluminum pieces bolted directly to the swivel disc of each of the motorized caster wheels. When it came time to add a set of contact sensing bumpers, which Tod referred to as "impact sensors", Tod devised an eight-sided polygon that would overlap, at some point, each vertice of the triangle. Those eight pieces of angle aluminum were of the following lengths:
 1: 18.250" (463.550mm)
 2: 11.000" (279.400mm)
 3: 10.500" (266.700mm)
 4: 14.625" (371.475mm)
 5: 11.750" (298.450mm)
 6: 14.625" (371.475mm)
 7: 10.500" (266.700mm)
 8: 11.000" (279.400mm)
There were also two additional "brace" pieces, however, they are irrelevant to the current discussion. These were of the following lengths:
 9:  8.625" (219.075mm)
10:  8.625" (219.075mm)
Each of the above listed pieces (one through eight) had specific angles cut on each end such that they could be assembled into the proper eight-sided polygon. Once the polygon had been constructed and attached to the 23" (584.2mm) motorized triangular inner frame, the impact sensors were then assembled and added. The impact sensor lengths were shorter than the initial lengths of the sides of the eight-sided frame and were actually slightly shorter than the sides to which they were to be attached. The impact sensor lengths were given as:
 1: 17.00" (431.80mm)
 2:  9.25" (234.95mm)
 3:  7.50" (190.50mm)
 4: 13.00" (330.20mm)
 5: 10.00" (254.00mm)
 6: 13.00" (330.20mm)
 7:  7.50" (190.50mm)
 8:  9.25" (234.95mm)
You would, of course, be forgiven for assuming that the lengths listed above for the impact sensors would also be the lengths of the sides of the polygon. Indeed, they are close enough in practice. However, by application of some basic mathematics, I was able to determine the actual lengths of the sides of the polygon to be:
 1: 17.188" (431.80mm)
 2:  8.782" (234.95mm)
 3:  7.576" (190.50mm)
 4: 12.597" (330.20mm)
 5: 10.072" (254.00mm)
 6: 12.597" (330.20mm)
 7:  7.576" (190.50mm)
 8:  8.782" (234.95mm)
In order to verify my calculations, I modeled the angle aluminum pieces in C.A.D. software and assembled the pieces on-screen. All of my calculations lined up precisely to the model with the exception of polygon side one. Polygon side one was calculated as 17.188" (mm), however, the initial C.A.D. model indicated that the actual length should be 17.485 (mm). After minor tweaking, the C.A.D. model indicated that the precise length of polygon side one should be 17.484" (mm).

At this point, you may be wondering as to the purpose of creating this eeight sided polygon. The answer is that most of the framework that Tod designed was created specifically for use with the TM20K370 Motorized Caster Wheels. Since these wheels are no longer available and alternatives must be used, then there is no need to fool around with constructing the triangular portion of the mainframe. Two of the eight-sided polygon pieces could simply be joined together with about 5" (mm) of spacing between them. Then, it should be a simple matter to attach whatever motorized wheels that you have to hand to the bottom of the structure. Note that the cutout in the centermost part of the eight sided figure is intended to be used for the battery cage and should support all common 100Ah, 12V batteries. You would likely not need the cutout in the top piece of the mainframe since the battery sits through the hole in the center of the bottom piece, resting comfortably in the battery cage and riding approximately 2" above ground level.

Including this particular set of files in this archive negates the need of designing a TM20K370 motorized wheel, which is the actual focus of this project. My reasons for including it is that it just happens to be a very useful method of building a full-scale MicroTron Robot Mainframe utilizing moderm motors and wheels.
